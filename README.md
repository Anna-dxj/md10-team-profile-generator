# Team Profile Generator [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)]

  ## Description
  The Team Profile Generator is a command line-run application that allows a manager to generate a webpage to display their team's basic information (name, role, email, work ID, and role-related information). This webpage is dynamically generated through command-line prompts.  This application should allow managers to have quick access to the team's emails and role-related inforamtion (such as github profile). 

  Through development of this application, I have gained more comfort with object-oriented programming, and writing and running unit tests.
